- "Dip a corner of one egg roll into the oil. If it begins to sizzle/bubble and cook, the oil is ready. If nothing happens, allow oil to heat up a little longer."
- "When oil is ready, carefully slide egg rolls in, or place them in oil with tongs. Allow to cook 1 minute (or until golden brown) then use tongs to turn and cook the other side."
- "Place cooked egg rolls on a clean cloth or paper towel to drain."
- "Eat warm. Also good reheated so can be prepared in advanced."
