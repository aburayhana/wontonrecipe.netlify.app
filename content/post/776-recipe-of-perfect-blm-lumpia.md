Lumpia originally came from China and the original version is usually made up of vegetables and is eaten as a snack. However, due to China&#39;s trade relationships with the different Asian nations. Lumpia first traveled to the Philippines in the ninth-century, and it&#39;s been a staple there ever since. Traditional lumpia usually includes some sort of meat and vegetable mixture that is then wrapped up.
