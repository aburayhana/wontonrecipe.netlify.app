People can be intimidated by cooking fish for tacos, but don&#39;t be! After marinating, the fish just needs to cook in a glug of olive oil for a few minutes per side in a skillet. Best Fish for Fish Tacos Cod, tilapia, or halibut are my go-to choices for fish tacos, but you could really use any white fish fillets. It doesn&#39;t really matter if the fish is a firm variety or more flakey; you break up the cooked fish into the tacos anyway, so perfect presentation isn&#39;t really important.

Best Fish for Fish Tacos Cod, tilapia, or halibut are my go-to choices for fish tacos, but you could really use any white fish fillets. It doesn&#39;t really matter if the fish is a firm variety or more flakey; you break up the cooked fish into the tacos anyway, so perfect presentation isn&#39;t really important. The tilapia is lightly pan-seared, rather than breaded and deep-fried, making these fish tacos a healthier alternative to many of their restaurant counterparts. Ingredients for Best Fish Taco Sauce: For the fish taco sauce, all you need is sour cream, mayo, lime juice, garlic powder and sriracha. The sriracha gives it a little kick of spice so you can add more or less based on your preference.
