Add fish sauce, lime juice, garlic, cilantro and chili peppers. Pickled chili peppers are used as a side condiment to many soups, noodles and stir-fries. These chilies deliver a milder version of heat, along with a sweet and sour note that complements many dishes well. When it comes to the perfect spring roll or egg roll dipping sauce, there are all kinds of options. If you&#39;re going store-bought, then I like to use a sweet Thai chili sauce or sometimes even just plain soy sauce or a sweet mushroom sauce.
