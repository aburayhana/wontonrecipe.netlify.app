M y friends know about me and gyoza. I can&#39;t resist these fried-then-steamed dumplings stuffed with pork, napa cabbage and garlic chives, so when we rolled into Osaka, we headed directly to a half-century old joint called Tenpei Gyoza, which claims to be the originator of the city&#39;s signature hitokuchi gyoza, one-bite gyoza. An easy and quick chewy and crispy, bite-sized bbq pork (char siu) gyoza dumplings recipe, for days when you are craving char siu bao as a snack but want something you can make in a pinch! Some specialty regional styles of preparing gyoza involve frying up bite-sized dumplings in a skillet and allowing them to stick together as they cook so the individual pieces become one glorious crispy fried batch of gyoza dumplings.

An easy and quick chewy and crispy, bite-sized bbq pork (char siu) gyoza dumplings recipe, for days when you are craving char siu bao as a snack but want something you can make in a pinch! Some specialty regional styles of preparing gyoza involve frying up bite-sized dumplings in a skillet and allowing them to stick together as they cook so the individual pieces become one glorious crispy fried batch of gyoza dumplings. Similar to yaki-gyoza but even crispier is age-gyoza, or deep-fried gyoza. When you chop the ingredients up this way it will be easier to fill the dumplings and nicer to bite into these &#39;bite-sized&#39; snacks. I add a handful of shrimps and minced, low-fat beef as well.
