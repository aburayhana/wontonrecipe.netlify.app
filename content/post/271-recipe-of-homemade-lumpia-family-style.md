recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare onion, carrots, etc by chopping fine - thin and small. Try to chop all the same size to cook evenly) In a large bowl mix the filling ingredients. If you want a stronger garlic flavor use minced instead of powdered)."
- "This is a basic mix. Feel free to experiment by adding other things you think may blend well. If you don&#39;t like it don&#39;t include it in the next batch."
- "Spread a wrapper, flat on a cutting board. Make a line of filling along one edge of the filling. If you have a forcing bag with a 1/2 inch plain tip, you&#39;ll save a lot of time. Otherwise grab a handful of the mix and form it into approx 1/2 inch tube shape 8&#34; long (same as wrapper)."
- "Roll the wrapper tightly around the filling. Stop about an inch short of the end and brush the egg wash along the length of the exposed wrapper remainder. The eggwash will keep the wrapper from coming apart. Then complete the roll."
- "Cut the tube wrapper in thirds. The ends will have filler exposed which purists may sneer at but that&#39;s part of what takes gobs of time which this method eliminates."
- "At this point you can cover and wait until you need to cook it or proceed directly with cooking. If you have a limited time to cook do the above the night before."
- "In a medium frying pan, heat oil to approx 375 degrees. Test the oil by dipping a few in and letting them golden. The first few in the oil will help judge if the oil is too hot or cool. Cook the rolled wrappers until the outside is golden brown. There is a myth that the wrapper needs to float to prove it&#39;s done. That may be true for bigger lumpia, but not the small lumpia."
- "One final step before serving, let the cooked lumpia rest for about 10 minutes. This will let the meat relax and juices mingle and reduce burned fingers and tongues. Enjoy. I&#39;d say something about leftovers but this is rarely a concern."

My boyfriend is Filipino and I&#39;ve eaten lumpia at every party and get-together we&#39;ve had with his family. This recipe is the closest thing to the lumpia his mother makes. Lumpia &amp; Company is a family owned restaurant in Virginia Beach and the elements of each family member can be found Enjoy Filipino Eggrolls like never before in both classic and innovative styles. Shanghai-style ground pork eggrolls with onion, garlic, carrot, and parsley.

Lumpia Family Style is one of the most favored of recent trending meals on earth. It's simple, it's quick, it tastes yummy. It is enjoyed by millions daily. They're fine and they look fantastic. Lumpia Family Style is something which I've loved my whole life.

##### The ingredients needed to make Lumpia Family Style:

1. Take  Filling basic:
1. Take  ground meat (beef, pork or chicken)

1. Take  onion (chopped fine)

Did you know that I am part Filipino? The richness of Filipino lumpia calls for a white wine that can cut through the grease and complement the Asian flavors of the dish. I&#39;d pair lumpia with a Sauvignon Blanc, like the Browne Family Vineyards Sauvignon Blanc. This wine has notes of green apple, lime, and passionfruit that complement the Filipino spices well.
