- "they&#39;ll be done when you can see the filling &#34;bubbling&#34; and the topping has browned and gotten crispy"
- "for a more crispy topping, turn the heat up to 400 and bake another few minutes, just keep an eye on them so they don&#39;t burn"
- "you can eat these warm, or let them cool and freeze or refrigerate them and enjoy later :) I enjoy them for breakfast!"
