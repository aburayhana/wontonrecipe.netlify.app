Place about three rounded tablespoons in the center of each wrapper making a short horizontal lump. Crab Rangoon Egg Rolls are stuffed with crab, cream cheese, green onions and the perfect blend of spices mimicking the classic crab rangoons with an extra large helping of the best part. I heat the oil in a heavy stock pot on the stove using a thermometer but a deep fryer would come in handy if you are preparing these for a holiday party or football game day fun. Dip each crab roll into the mixture, then dredge in the flour.

I heat the oil in a heavy stock pot on the stove using a thermometer but a deep fryer would come in handy if you are preparing these for a holiday party or football game day fun. Dip each crab roll into the mixture, then dredge in the flour. Heat oil in a heavy pot, enough oil to submerge eggrolls. They will cook quickly, so keep an eye. Once they get golden brown, remove from oil and drain on paper towels.
